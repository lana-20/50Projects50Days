In this project I am building expanding cards. 
Basically, I am styling panels to have a background image and a heading. 
I am using flex blocks to align everything. 
And, then adding JavaScript, so that when I click one of the panels, 
it changes the class to active and then expands with the CSS transition.

Using the following:
1) JavaScdript - for the event listeners
2) CSS transitions - to give it the smooth-trough effect. The heading doesn't come in until the card is fully expanded.
3) Background images and headings - but you can make these into testimonials, FAQs, etc.
