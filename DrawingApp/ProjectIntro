This is a drawing app created with the help of HTML5 canvas.
I am using a canvas element, which is the big square.
I am using a JavaScript API to draw shapes, such as circles, rectangles, images.
I am implementing this with mouse events, so that I can actually click and draw.
There are controls on the bottom, where I can change the color.
I can also change the width of the pen line. When going down to 5, 
which is the lowest value, the line is smaller. The highest thickness is 50.
The drawing can be cleared with the X button.
