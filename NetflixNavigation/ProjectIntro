in this project, I am creating a mobile navigation effect - a responsive navigation hamburger menu.
I branded it Netflix Mobile Navigation, just because of the color scheme. It's not the actual Netflix menu.
I have a hamburger menu icon. When clicking it, there's this effect where three separate 
parts come out in a transition and some of them have delay. I have black, red, white when they come out.
And when it goes in - white, red, black. It's a nice effect on a clean looking menu.
You can put whatever you want on the page, I am just putting the logo and some text.
If you make the screen really small, it still works. There's a minimum width of 320px, 
so it should look good on the smartphones and other mobile devices.
