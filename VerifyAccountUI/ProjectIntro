I am creating a verify account UI, which you might see when you sign up for something, 
and they send you code and you have to validate that code on a website or some kind of app.
This is just the UI part. I am not adding any kind of functionality other than the UI,
and typing in numbers and have it hop to each input, becase there are six separate inputs.
When you come to the page, it focuses on the first input. You can put in a number, and it
brings you to the next input. You can put another number, another one. And if you want to 
go back and change the number, you can hit the backspace and put a different number and continue on.
If you want to change the number again, you can do that. And then, typically, you would 
enter and have it validate with your database and authentication and so on. But this is just the UI.
