I really like this cool-looking project.
Basically, I just have a simple article.
It can be anything at all, any web site, blog, etc.

In the top left there is a navigation icon.
When clicking it, it rotates the entire website, the entire container.
And then it brings in the navigation items from the side.
The icon also changes. There are two positions - open and close.
When clicking it, the circle rotates and shows the close button.

Using the following:
1) Some JavaScript to be able to add and remove the specific class, 
called show-nav, that will rotate and bring the menu in.
2) Mostly dealing with CSS to add specific styles for specific elements.
