This is a simple but useful project, because there are a lot of times when you need to notify a user of something, 
whether it's an error or an info block. And you will often see the toast notifications. 
A toast will pop up in the upper or lower corner, or you can put it in the middle.
The notification disappears after a few seconds. You don't want it to just stay there.
You can have multiple notifications because multiple things might have happened, 
and then they all go away after a certain amount of time.
For fun, I am randomizing the messages and the types. Some of them have different colors. 
Green is success, red is error, purple is info.
I am randomizing all of those, as well as showing how you can add a specific message and a specific type.
You can use this in form validation or similar scenario.
