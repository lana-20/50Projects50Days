This project is for hidden search, 
a cool little widget you can add to a web site or application.

I have a button with a search icon.
When clickicg it, it fires off a JavaScript event that activates a specific class,
where I add a transition for the width of the input to get wider and 
the button to move over using a transform: translateX.
When clickicg it again, it shrinks back up.

Using the following: 
1) CSS transitions
2) JavaScript to add the event and toggle the class.
