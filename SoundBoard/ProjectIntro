In this project, I am working with the HTML5 audio tag and creating a sound board 
with different effects. When clicking a button, it makes a sound effect. 
If the sound is still playing, when clicking another one, 
it's going to stop that effect and start the next one.
I achieved this by using audio tags*, but I am not showing controls.

I am doing everything through JavaScript. 
If you capture an audio element with .getElementById, for example, you have some methods and properties 
on that object that you bring in, such as play, pause, and so on.
