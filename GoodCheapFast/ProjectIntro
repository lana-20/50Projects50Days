In this project, I am taking checkboxes and styling them to look like sliders 
with balls that I can animate back and forth.
I am styling them with CSS and adding some animations to give it this effect.

Then, I am adding some fun JavaScript logic, because when you have a project, 
you rarely get it to be good, cheap, and fast.
If you choose good, cheap and then click fast, it's going to uncheck cheap.
You might get it to be good and fast, but it's not going to be cheap.
You can do cheap and fast, can do cheap and good, 
but cannot do all three, because it's very rear.

You can use these slider widgets inside your user interfaces and websites.
