In this project, I am creating an increment counter that you might have seen on some websites.
I am showing numbers, using Twitter, YouTube and Facebook fans, but you can use any number.
When you come to the website initially, you can see that it counts from zero up.
You can set the increment to whatever you like, to make it faster or slower.
I am making it responsive, so that when it's on a small screen it goes vertical.
