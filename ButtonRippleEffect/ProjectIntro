In this project, I am creating a button ripple effect.
You will be able to have buttons and give them a specific class of ripple.
When clicking on those buttons, you will get this ripple effect. 
It's not just a ripple effect in the center, it's wherever you click on a button.
I am adding animation and styling with CSS. 
Using JavaScript to be able to pinpoint where exactly I am clicking, so that I can 
change some of the CSS values of the positioning to give it that effect in that exact position.
