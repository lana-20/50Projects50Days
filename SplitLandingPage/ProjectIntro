In this project, I am creating a split landing page. I am making it to be PlayStation 5 and XBox Series X.
You might have a store where a customer can choose one of these gaming consoles when they get released.

I am creating a split screen with a bakground image, an overlay and some content inside.
When clicking on the left side, it streches out to 75%. The other side - 25%.
When hovering over the right side, it does the same thing.

The project is CSS-heavy, with a little bit of JavaScript for the hover effects.
