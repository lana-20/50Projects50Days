In this project, I'm building progress steps  which you might see in different 
kinds of websites with multi-level forms, shopping carts, etc.
This is a progress bar which starts at 1 and goes along to 4. It can go back and forth.
It's not an actual form, but I have Prev and Next buttons to control the steps.

At the beginning, when starting at 1, the Prev button is disabled.
  When going to Next, it has a blue transition outline and Next's border lights up.
    When you get to the last [node], the Next button is disabled.
