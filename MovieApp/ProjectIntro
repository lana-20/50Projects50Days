In this project, I am building a movie app using third party API from https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api.
It yields a giant database of movies with the title, ratings, images and lots of other data.

First, I am creating the UI, working with HTML and CSS. I am registering the API key with the TMBD service.
I am using JavaScript to make the fetch request to get the data to show most popular movies at the time.
I have this hover effect where it shows the overview of each movie. 
It also shows the rating. I have special colors depending on what the rating is.
If it's above 8, it's green; between 5 and 8 - orange; below 5 - red.
I am also adding a search functionality. If I search for the word "july" and enter, 
it is getting me all the movies with the word "july" in the title, or at least the first 20-30.

This application gives a good idea on how to use the fetch API, working with the third party data service 
or data API, and putting those into the DOM (adding data to the DOM, to the page).
