In this project, I am getting a bit into the drag-and-drop functionality.
I am creating and styling boxes. I have one <div> inside each one of these boxes,
which has a background image coming from Unsplash, just a random image.
When you grab it, the image you are holding has a class of hold, which gives it a faint grey border.
Each of the these boxes that you hover over gets a class of hovered, a dark background, and a white dashed border.
If you drop the image, it will go in whichever of the boxes you are hovering over.
The project gives an understanding of how drag and drop works. You can build some interfaces or even games with it.
