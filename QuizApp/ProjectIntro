In this project, I am creating a quiz application.
I have this question on the page, "Which language runs in a web browser?".
I have some multiple choice answers. If I choose "JavaScript" and submit, 
it's taking me to the next question "What does CSS stand for?". I am choosing "Cars SUVs Sailboats". 
Then next question "What does HTML stand for?". I am choosing "Hypertext Markup Language". 
And then the next question "When was JavaScript launched?". Which is "1995". 
When I submit, I can see that "You answered 3/4 questions correctly".
And I can reload the quiz. It's pretty simple in terms of basic functionality.
I am creating a basic template that I can use to insert the questions and answers, using a JavaScript array.
And then I am adding functionality to select an answer, check it, add to the score and increment it.
