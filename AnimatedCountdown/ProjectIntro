I am building an animated countdown. What you see on the page initially is the final message/state.
But if you click replay or reload the page, you get a really nice looking animation counting from 3 to 0.
You can make it any range of numbers you want. It's something you can put before your website or application loads.
I am working with CSS animations, keyframes. I am using the transform property with translate, rotate, scale.
Then I am using JavaScript to check some conditions and either add or remove certain classes, based on those conditions.
Have to know whether to create the in or the out classs to create the rotation to stop it (is the counter at the end of the numbers?).
