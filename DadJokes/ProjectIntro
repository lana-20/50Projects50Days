In this project, I am building a dad joke application where it gives you a joke.
You can click a button to get a new joke, and you can keep getting new jokes.

I am achieving this by making HTTP requests to a third party API https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api.
I am using Fetch API, that is built into the browser to make a request and get an object with 
an id, a joke and a status: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch.
And I am taking that joke and putting it into the application.
The code shows how to use Fetch normally, as well as with Async/Await.
