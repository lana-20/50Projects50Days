In this project, I am creating a todo list, which has a pretty clean design.
You are able to add a todo. Type in eg. "Todo One", enter, "Todo Two", enter, and so on.
The todos will keep getting added. If you reload the page, they are going to stay, 
because I am implementing local storage at the end. 
First, I am creating the layout design. 
Then I am adding a functionality in the DOM, where I can add a todo.
You can also mark a todo as completed. If you left click, it gets marked complete.
And if you right click, it will actually delete that todo.
Addition of the DOM functionality and implementation of local storage 
enables for the todos to stay, when you leave or reload the page.
