I am making a login form, where the length of the password is going to be detected.
The background image starts off blurry. As the password becomes longer and stronger, 
the image becomes clearer. If you enter one character, the image becomes a little clearer, 
then add another and another until it eventually ends up being a completely clear image.

It's a way to test password strength. This project is simple, it only goes by the password length.
You can add onto this to check for special characters, uppercase letters, numbers, etc.

I am using a Tailwind CSS framework. I am only using the CDN (https://cdnjs.com/libraries/tailwindcss).
I am not downloading or compliling it in any way. I am not using npm.
I am merely adding a CDN link so that I can use some of the classes and make the styling easier.
