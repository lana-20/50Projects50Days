In this project I am building a scroll animation, which is pretty simple but very useful.
You might see the websites where you start scrolling and parts of the site, such as images or other sections of the web site start to come in.

I am creating content blocks. There are 3 to begin with.
When scrolling down, the next one comes in from the left.
When going down some more, next one comes in from the right.
And it alternates where it comes in from.


Using the following: 
1) CSS transitions - to have it come in smoothly.
2) JavaScript - to tell where the trigger point is for the next box to come in. 
   Then adding a specific class to show it. 
   When going back up, it removes the class when it hits the trigger point.
