In this project, I am creating a game called Catch The Insect.
I have the first screen which shows the name of the game, I click "Play Game".
It shows the next screen where I can select a specific insect. Let's say Fly.
And immediately a fly gets put on the screen, and the timer starts going, and the score is showing.
If I click on the insect, it generates two more. Click another one, it generates two more again.
And they are basically just going to keep coming. The faster I click, the faster they come.
When the score gets to 20, I get a message "Are you annoyed yet? You are playing an impossible game!"
Because the insects are going to keep coming as I click, without end. There's no end to the game, it's impossible to win.
It's a silly game, but there's a lot to learn in terms of setting the timer, inserting random objects into the DOM.
The insects all have a random rotation, they all face random ways. There's quite a bit of JavaScript to handle all of it.
