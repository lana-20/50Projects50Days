This is a project for picking random choices.
There is a text area. As soon as you start to type, eg. "choice1", it will format as a tag under the text area.
To create another choice, you need to put a comma and start to type again, eg. ",choice2,choice3,choice4". 
You can add as many choices as you want. As soon you hit enter it's going to give you an 
effect of tags highlighting, until it stops on a random choice. It's also going to clear the text area.
