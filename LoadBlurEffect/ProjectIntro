In this project, I am building a blurry loading page or loading image.
When opening the page, the image starts blurred. 
It starts with 0% and then goes up to 100% and the image comes into focus.
You can use this to load just about anything.

I am just doing a blur effect on the image, but you can load it in your site.
You can have any other elements in the DOM load in that specific 
amount of time from when you go from 0 to 100.

I am mapping different number ranges to the 0-100 load.
For instance, the image blur is 30 px when it starts, 
and it goes down to 0 px, as it goes from 0% to 100%.
Using a StackOverflow function for mapping one number range to another.
