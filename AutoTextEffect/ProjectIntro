In this project, I am making an auto text, or auto typing, effect.
You might have seen this on different websites where the text types out by itself.
I am adding this effect, styling it, and adding a speed control.
It starts at 1. If you make it to 2, it will go faster.
When you make it 3, 4, 5, it keeps getting faster. It has a max of 10, which you can adjust if you wish.
This is something you might see on a hero banner website, which wouldn't usually have the speed control.
I am using the speed control to practice adding event listeners to make things happen in the DOM.
