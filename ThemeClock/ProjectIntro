I am building a theme clock, where I am using CSS to style the hands/needles, 
which are the hour, the minute, and the second.
I am using JavaScript to power it and have it show the current time.
It updates every second and ticks like an actual clock.
I am showing the digital readout of the time, the day, and the date. 
You are able to toggle it to Dark mode and then back to Light mode.
