In this project, I am building a notes app.
To be able to actually save these notes to local storage, 
I am using the local storage API which is built into the browser.

I have nothing on the page, but the "Add note" button. And if I click that, it adds a note.
Inside the note, I can click and type eg. "Hello World".
The Edit button will toggle from the text area to just a regular div that shows the text.
I can add another note, say eg. "Hello Again". Now I have two notes.
If I reload, they are going to stay because they are saved in local storage.
If I delete one note and reload, it's going to stay the same, 
because it's been saved to the local browser and local storage.

Another thing I can do is use markdown, becase I am using a small library called Marked.
For an unordered list I use hyphen (-), for a heading a number sign (#), and so on.
You can look up and study the markdown syntax on your own.

This is a neat application to practice local storage, work with the DOM, add and remove items, etc.
It is basically a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) appication with markdown.
