In this project, I am building a Pokedex, which is basically a bunch of Pokemon cards.
I have 150 cards, with the image, the id of the Pokemon, the name, and the type. 
Depending on the type, I set the card background to a specific color. 
Grass is green, fire is a pinkish red color, water is blue, and so on.
To get the data, I use the Poke API https://pokeapi.co/. You can get it by id, get abilities, etc.
I am fetching some basic data and creating these nice looking cards.
It is fully responsive. I am using a flex box, so it looks good on small screens.
I am using the fetch APIs and async/await. 
I am manipulating some of the data a little to get the desired result.
