I am building a testimonial box widget, which shows a testimonial with a user and a progress bar.
After 10 seconds, when the progress bar hits the end, it switches to the next testimonial.
I have an array in JavaScript with the text, image, link to the image, role, and basically
switch it up every time that this progress bar is up (every 10 seconds).
I am using setInterval to do that, and creating the animaiton using @keyframes in the CSS.
