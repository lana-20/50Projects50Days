In this project, I am creating a mobile UI, with an image for the content and menu tabs on the bottom.
I have Home, Work, Blog, and About Us tabs. It shows a different image depending on which tab you click.
I have a specific class of show on the content, and a specific class of active on the tabs.
The active tab is highlighted in purple. I loop through the list items in the menu and add an event listener
onto each one, so that I can add and remove certain classes onto the content as well as onto the items themselves.
