In this project, I am building a content placeholder.
It looks like an ordinary card, has an image, some text, 
a user/author image and some data.
When coming to the page or reloading, you can see the gradient animation 
that loads in about 2.5 seconds and then the content comes in.

The approach is to first build out just the card with HTML and CSS.
Then I am creating the animation with CSS, basically modifying 
the background position of a linear gradient.
Then I have JavaScript insert the content. 
The content is hardcoded in JavaScript. 
You can fetch the data from an API, if you wish.
