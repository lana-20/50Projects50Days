In this project, I am building an image carousel that shows several images. It slides through them.
The carousel slides on its own, but I also has Prev and Next buttons to control it.
You can click Next to the end, then it goes back to the beginning.
You can go back by clicking Prev. If you get to the beginning and click Prev, it goes to the end.
