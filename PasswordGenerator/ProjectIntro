In this project, I am building a password generator. 
The idea is that you can choose the length, which I set to 20 by default.
You can choose uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Let's say you want a 10-character-long password with uppercase, lowercase, 
numbers, but not symbols - you can click the button Generate Password and get it.
You might want to get a 5-character-long password with uppercase, 
lowercase, numbers, and symbols - you can do that too. 
I am also adding a functionality where you can click the button and copy 
the password to the clipboard and paste it in the destination of your choice.
